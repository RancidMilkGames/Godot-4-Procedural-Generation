This version of introduction on 21-FEB-2023

I wanted to make an atmosphere similar to *medieval* (?) European Bible books but remaining feeling of atheism, modern aesthetics and futuristic like telling endless histories, things in current times influenced by them and future. I mixed blackletter, humanist and square in my concept, then this project is created.



Deja vu of *Girls' Last Tour*

In plan this project has compability on Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters.
